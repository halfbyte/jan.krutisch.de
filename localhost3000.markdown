# Why the localhost3000.de thing

When I started doing rails work, I had a blog (the first blog I've been writing in english) at localhost3000.de, detailing my progress into rails land. It was just a funny idea at the time to register that name and it actually had some interesting effects, I remember that I wanted to do something with jaiku (anyone remember that?) and somehow they blocked domains containing "localhost" in the form.

A few years later, Google Chrome apparently started to show suggestions for "localhost3000.de" as soon as you tried to visit locahost:3000 with rails not being completely booted up. I found it funny and then at some point just abandoned the blog and redirected to jan.krutisch.de, which is where I keep all my stuff now.

But every now and then, someone on twitter cracked up on my "domain hack" and I finally gave in to the idea to capitalize on this fortunate fluke. And when I mean "capitalize", I mean to have a good laugh about it, generate some link juice and, yes, have ads on the page. The ads, which I assume will just continue to destroy my idealistic hope of making money with smarter-than-usual ads, might make me some money, eventually. Since I arrived at this situation without almost any doing on my part, all ad revenue made by this page will go into donations of my choosing.

I'll keep the link juice, thank you very much.

Apart from that, I am open to suggestions for good links I can put on the page to actually help people.

I hope you understand and forgive me. And with you, I mean google. :)
