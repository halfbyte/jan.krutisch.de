<h2>Book me as a speaker</h2>
<p><a href="mailto:jan+wwwspeaking@krutisch.de">I can</a> and have talked on a wide range of subjects in web development but also hacking in general. I am fluent in english and german and can switch from one to another if needed during a talk.</p>
<p>The cost for having me speaking at your event heavily depends on the event itself. If it is interesting to me, I'll come if you pay transportation, accommodation and of course a free ticket. If not, I'll make you a modest offer on a speaking fee. If you can't pay for transportation/ accommodation, your event needs to be really, really good. As in Reboot good. Just ask.</p>

<h2>Previous talks</h2>
<p>Currently this is a selection of talks I've given in the past, mostly collected from my slideshare account. It is by no means a complete list.</p>
