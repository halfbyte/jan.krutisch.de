Usually, this would be one of the posts I would start writing in german, but, after looking at my GA stats this morning, I found out that the vast majority of my readers now seems to be english. It might very well be that this blog will be english only from now on. Anyway, let's get to the post itself.

Today, when I walked through the local supermarket (after having bought most of the stuff that we needed at the local farmers market and one of these organic super markets that crop up everywhere now), I felt strangely alienated. Looking at the vast display of convenience food and other heavily processed goods, I realized how little all these things mean to me now.

Now, I don't write this to brag about how cool I am and that I am such a good human for not touching all that evil large corporation food, largely because I am actually not very strict about my food choices. I drink Coke, for example, although I probably shouldn't. I eat sausages I buy in plastic packs in the super market, although I only do that relatively seldom nowadays, and I probably shouldn't. I actually do like a nice box of industrial cookies, although it probably will kill me one day (too much fat, bad for my cholesterol, too much sugar, cocoa probably harvested on farms depending on cheap labor and exploitation etc., etc.)

But there's a whole array of things I seem to have excluded myself from completely. Some of them never really were part of my diet, for example canned soups and other "readymade" meals.

But there's so much more. And I keep wondering weather the world of mainstream food just kept on pushing into areas where I'd be uncomfortable or if my choices simply kept getting "better" what ever that means.

Here's a list that may or may not be interesting, complete or even helpful:

- Soft drinks. I love them. It's just that 80% of the stuff I can find in a normal super market is meaningless to me.
- Convenience food. Mentioned above, but really, I mean every kind of convenience food. Preboiled rice? Pasta? Srsly? A currywurst for the microwave? Now, seriously, I love currywurst, but that's exactly why I buy it at a nice wurst place, ready made (very convenient, I don't even need a microwave!), hot, and damn tasty.
- Non organic vegetables. Now, I know, this is kind of controversial and there's a lot of pseudo-organic stuff even in the organic supermarkets, so your best bet is either buying directly from the producing farmer or to become part of a
