Operating systems are a curious thing. They are usually more opinionated than application software, they are often used as a tool to lock users in and, despite everything we (the web peeps) were hoping for, are probably not going away soon.

I am, since around the end of 2006, an almost exclusive user of Apple Hard- and Software. And I mean it. All my computers, routers, music players, tablets and telephones are Apple. And while I do see the potential peril that comes with this monoculture, I am still pretty happy with it. Usually. Most of the time.

But somehow, throughout the last year, some cracks have started to appear. The first, obvious one is Mac OS X Lion. It is, by far, the crappiest release of OS X since I'm using it. It eats memory like nothing, which means that it is close to unusable on my 2007 iMac which is maxed out at 3 GB. It's less of an issue on my current 8 GB MBP, but still. It also degrades extremely ungraceful, meaning complete lockups as soon as someone starts swapping. And with complete lockups I mean the whole thing: Apps not responding, Beachballs everywhere, all machines stop. Also, the fullscreen stuff is very nice in theory and stumbles over the simplest of problems: Multi monitor setups. There's some nice stuff in Lion, no doubt, the fast boot (if it's working) is amazing and the built in versioning (while having a rather weird implementation) for arbitrary files is nice. Although I still do believe that this should be solved at file system level, which seems to be a hard problem.

Now XCode. Starting with 4.2 and especially 4.2.1, all kinds of weird problems seem to pop up, most of them due to the fact that these versions don't supply a proper gcc version anymore, if I understood this correctly.

All of which makes me feel a bit weird inside. Like I am suddenly, as a non Apple devleoper (meaning: Not writing iOS or MacOS X apps) a second class citizen and the people that are responsible for packaging up XCode are simply not caring anymore (note that you need to manually install the "command line tools" if you install XCode 4.3 from the App Store).

Of course, the open source advocates have always warned us Apple fanboys that this will happen. You know what? I'm not going to retreat so easily. Because I've been using Linux before you kids got your first computer. And I've been, between 2005 and 2007 using Linux exclusively on my main workstation. With a tiling window manager. And ran away from all of that as soon as I've worked on OS X for a few weeks. Because it felt right for me. It was all so effortless. It didn't stand in your way. TextMate was nice and new and was updated regularly. Okay, I had some weird issues in between with MacPorts but with the advent of homebrew, and a clean slate when Snow Leopard came out, my machine and me, we felt invincible. And I still believe that Mac OS X is almost unreachable in overall quality. 

But being effortless has many facettes. And homebrew still doesn't come close to aptitude and the Ubuntu package repo. Well, if you can stand some rather oldish packages (My main gripe with most Linux distros, actually). The terminal on OS X pretty much sucks if compared to Linux.

So, I'm actually toying with the thought of switching to Ubuntu for some time. To see how it feels in 2012. To see how it performs on a rather recent machine. To see how easy it will be to set up a decent development environment. To see how well it can deal with the intricacies of my Apple MacBook Pro. Because I'm not giving up on using Apple Hardware anytime soon.

But maybe the time is right to start preparing for a time when using Apple computers as a developer becomes too painful. If Apple continues on the current path of focusing on Apple only developers (which probably even makes sense from their position) and continues to throw rocks into our paths, this time might come more earlier than I had hoped.

Which is sad. I really love most of the work Apple has done since Steve Jobs came back. I love how they single handedly decided how music will be sold in the 21st century. I love how they constantly improved and reduced the design of their computers (and I do love my current MBP hardware). And I love iOS and they way it still runs way ahead of its competition. There are some black spots (As a software developer I'd love to have more direct access to the hardware and I'd love to install Software without that certificate mess), but most of the decisions they get flak for are very sensible and can only be explained when you see that iOS is a mass market OS with end users ranging from hardcore geeks to, well, your mom.

Nevertheless, as I said, as a developer I have different needs. And, until Lion, I felt pretty good about OS X on the Macs, as it seemed that Apple cared for ALL THE developers. And now, in 2012, I'm sadly watching OS X falling apart in places that are mostly relevant for developers or, let's refocus, "pro users". Until Lion, it all seemed balanced - It was a nice, easy to learn OS for the noobs, but it catered for pros as well. And while I can imagine that
