title: Who am I kidding?

As a conference speaker, this year has been, so far, very, very disappointing. As it looks, I can basically hand in anything to Railswaycon and get drafted, but I didn't manage to sneak in a single talk into any other conference.

Now, actually, my track record of giving talks at international conferences is not very good and if you see [my list of talks I gave(/speaking.html), you will mostly find german conferences or at least conferences held in german, with the unfortunate shift 2010, where I had to present remotely after being stuck in germany by means of a not-so-nice icelandic volcano. 

This year, with me going freelance and stuff, I had the plan of levelling up my game here. And, so far, failed miserably. And after the announcement of Euroko's speaker list, which is strangely absent of any talk by yours truly, I have to step back and look back at what I've done and how I can learn from it.

After not being accepted into the Scottisch Ruby Conference (which I will nevertheless happily attend very soon), I had a brief exchange with the twitter account of them about the feedback that you usually *don't* get when your talk is rejected and how this is not very helpful especially for speakers in a position like mine who try to get better at things.

## But really, who am I kidding?

My conference proposal strategy in the last years basically looked like this: Hastily write together something on a spontaneous idea, hand it in, get selected on criteria mostly opaque to me and then spending the last week before the conference to turn a bad idea into a half descent talk. This is not the optimal strategy if you're trying to become a speaker at one of the very high profile conferences we now call the european Ruby conference circus.

Of course, there's a reason for me to do it like that - First of all, I almost always forget to do proposals on time and hand them in in the very last minute. Secondly, and to admit this is quite painful - I don't have a lot of interesting things to say about the things I did throughout the last few years. So, with the notable exception of my ubiquitous HAML/Sass talk, most of my Talk proposals were more about what I would like to work with than what I actually used. It's sometimes okay to write and talk about these things, but the result is seldom execellent. And third, I was doing it because it largely worked. I don't say this to diss conferences that are stupid enough to actually invite me - I have spoken at some awesome conferences - But to state that obviously there are some huge differences in terms of how difficult it is to get yourself on the speakers list.

I'm also not saying this to diss my own talks. With the exception of one particular talk I gave in a grumpy mood, slightly hungover, badly prepared and without anything useful to say during last summer, I am quite confident about the contents and quality of my talks.

Also, I repeatedly handed in talks about things that were supposed to happen in the future (for example using a certain database in an upcoming project). The future, though, has a tendency to ignore talk proposals. These things almost never work out the way they were planned. Projects are cancelled, technologies changed, Budgets are cut, people die, you get the picture. As Zach Holman so eloquently demonstrated in his talk at the wonderful Railsberry conference which was very nicely presented but lacked substance in every aspect, most probably because he had had not enough time to bring his stats project to a stage where it would output any meaningful metrics, I am not alone in this.

That all being said, here's my few simple rules I came up with how I will try to turn this thing around:

## Speak (and propose) only about things you are actually very knowledgable or at least very, very passionate about.

I have handed in talks on things I was merely interested in. This is not enough. There are quite a few things I know I'm very passionate about, but also, the list of things I am knowledgable about constantly evolves.

Also, my emotional involvement in a topic has a much greater influence on how well the talk will be given than any other criteria. Some of the best talks I gave were about something I cared greatly about but which were completely unprepared.



## Proposals are not about the future.

From now on I will refrain from handing in proposals that are based on hypothetical things that might happen in some version of the future. 

## Seek feedback on the proposals if they're rejected

I'm a bit reluctant to ask for feedback on my current proposals because, as I explained earlier, they are probably not worth it. As I hope to change that in the future,  

## Change the proposal mode from pull to push

This is probably the most important goal. I will come up with an up-to-date list of proposals (not necessarily public) I can hand in spontaneously. I did this for a while with my HAML/Sass and MongoDB talks, because both things were popular topics and both talks were relatively well-received.
