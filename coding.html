<h2>Available for hire</h2>
<p><a href="mailto:jan+wwwcoding@krutisch.de">I am available for hire</a>, but unfortunately, due to other arrangements, only on a day-by-day or at least week-by-week basis.</p>
<p>What am I good at? Glad you asked. I am an all round web developer. This means that I am able to write semantic HTML (As usual, this page is probably not the best example of my work), can generate this HTML with a wide range of server technologies, although I am definitely most fluent in Ruby, write pretty decent Javascript, even for complex applications, and can style the whole semantic mess with my above average knowledge of CSS, CSS3 and the various proprietary extensions in modern browsers.</p>
<p>I have some expertise in creating mobile applications with HTML and Javascript, using various frameworks or simple standards based mechanisms such as media queries</p>
<p>I would love to do projects for iOS or Android, but I would not claim that I am in any way an expert in these things. This hopefully changes in the future.</p>

<p>I am also, should the need arise, available for pure consulting work, for example examining technical feasibility for a project.</p>

<p>My daily rate pretty much depends on the customer, the timeframe and the work that needs to be done, but please don't ask me for a daily rate of 200 EUR or to work purely for equity. For one I am relatively risk averse and also I am very, very good at what I do.</p>

<h2>Projects I've been involved in</h2>
<p>This space will get much more crowded in the future. It is a wild mixture of fun projects, client projects and case studies.</p>
<p>For now, please feel free to take a look at my <a href="https://github.com/halfbyte">GitHub Account</a> to see my open source projects and contributions.</p>
