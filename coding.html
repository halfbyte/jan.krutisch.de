<h2>Available for hire</h2>
<p><a href="mailto:jan+wwwcoding@krutisch.de">I am available for hire</a>, but unfortunately, due to other arrangements, only on a day-by-day or at least week-by-week basis.</p>
<p>What am I good at? Glad you asked. I am an all round web developer. This means that I am able to write semantic HTML (As usual, this page is probably not the best example of my work), can generate this HTML with a wide range of server technologies, although I am definitely most fluent in Ruby, write pretty decent Javascript, even for complex applications, and can style the whole semantic mess with my above average knowledge of CSS, CSS3 and the various proprietary extensions in modern browsers.</p>
<p>I have some expertise in creating mobile applications with HTML and Javascript, using various frameworks or simple standards based mechanisms such as media queries</p>
<p>I would love to do projects for iOS or Android, but I would not claim that I am in any way an expert in these things. This hopefully changes in the future.</p>

<p>I am also, should the need arise, available for pure consulting work, for example examining technical feasibility for a project.</p>

<p>My daily rate pretty much depends on the customer, the timeframe and the work that needs to be done, but please don't ask me for a daily rate of 200 EUR or to work purely for equity. For one I am relatively risk averse and also I am very, very good at what I do.</p>

<h2>Projects I've been involved in</h2>

<h3>m.ftd.de</h3>

<p>The new mobile website of the now defunct financial times deutschland was a rather short lived project. I really enjoyed building both the prototype with the amazing <a href="http://precious-forever.com/">precious forever</a> and the final product with a team that included my dear friends <a href="http://dennisreimann.de/">Dennis Reimann</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/erotte">Eckhard Rotte</a>.</p>
<p>Technically speaking, the app is built in a minimal amount of PHP (the backend is based on the standard G+J CMS and our little team had nothing to do with it) and liberal amounts of JavaScript with an app largely based on Backbone.js</p>

<h3><a href="http://m.mydocumenta.de">m.mydocumenta.de</a></h3>
<p>A quick project for my single largest client in 2012, dpa infocom. We built a smallish app based on bottle.py that consumed the content API of the HNA CMS (HNA being the client we built this for) and served it as a twitter bootstrap based responsive web site that used a little JavaScript for making the whole thing web app capable (which means that if you install the app to your iOS home screen, clicking links doesn't leave the web app container) and some gallery swipey-thingie.</p>

<h3><a href="http://www.artdoxa.com">artdoxa.com</a></h3>
<p>A very cozy but active arts community by a hamburgian artist and illustrator named <a href="http://www.jochenhein.com/">Jochen Hein</a>. This was the first Rails project my splendid former employer <a href="http://mindmatters.de/">mindmatters.de</a> ever did, and the code based has been laying dormant for a few years after it became clear that it was not viable for both Jochen and mindmatters to keep maintaining it. After I started freelancing in early 2012, I became part of the artdoxa team and I am now currently in the rather tedious process of refactoring that old app from the inside out to make it more feasible to start actively developing on that code base. Watch this space</p>

<h3><a href="http://shelflists.com">shelflists.com</a></h3>
<p>
  This is a smallish hobby project of mine that gets very variying attention from me. The idea is to build a library tool like delicious library for mac, but do it online. There's lots of things I'd like to add (for example a bar code reading app for mobile phones to quickly scan in a lot of books), but it currently doesn't really have a very high priority.
</p>

<h3><a href="http://straightouttacotton.com/">Straight Outta Cotton</a></h3>
<p>Another private hobby project: I love T-Shirts and straightouttacotton.com aims to be just a very comprehensive database of cool, funny or simply beautiful T-Shirts (and the occasional hoodie).</p>

<h3><a href="http://cloudtracker.fm/">Cloudtracker 2.0</a></h3>
<p>Done with my buddy <a href="http://kannalles.net/">Sven Steinheisser</a> at the Music Hackday Amsterdam in 2012, the cloudtracker is a functional web version of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protracker">Protracker</a>, a four track, sample based music creator written for the AMIGA. It uses the Web Audio API to render the .mod files in real time.</p>

<h3><a href="http://pixelpoke.de/halfplayer/">Halfplayer</a></h3>
<p>Done for the Audio version of the Mozilla dev derby, this is basically only the player of cloudtracker (with, if you are inclined to know, a different library in the background to unify sound output). .mod-file parsing and replay is all done in javascript. Technically works on iOS-devices, currently borks on the security prescriptions of mobile webkit.</p>
