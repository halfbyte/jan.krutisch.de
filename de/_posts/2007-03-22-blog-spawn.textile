To separate concerns, I set up a new english-only blog at <a href="http://localhost3000.de/"  title="localhost:3000">http://localhost3000.de/</a> that will focus on Rails, Web-Development and the foo's and bar's in the life of a web developer. 

This blog will focus more on the personal side of me and everything to related to my profession. And it will continue to be mostly german.
