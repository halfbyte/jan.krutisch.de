Well, let's just say I'm working on some stuff for the german rails user group. Stuff to aggregate events. And I try to make this stuff as flexible as possible.

 
<div id="hcalendar-The-day-it-happened." class="vevent"><abbr class="dtstart" title="2009-01-31T20:00+01:0000">January 31th 8pm</abbr> : <abbr class="dtend" title="2009-01-07">7th, 2009</abbr> <span class="summary">The day it happened.</span> at <span class="location">My Home</span>
<div class="description">This is just a test event.</div>
</div>
