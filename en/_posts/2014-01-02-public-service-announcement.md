I have three computers I use on and off. On each of them, I have a relatively long blog post draft lying around I haven't gotten around to finish and publish.

That's not a good sign.

Over the course of the last weeks and festivities, I gave that some thought. And I believe I have found an answer, although I am not very happy with it.

2013 was the year when, at least for me, the last pieces of that already pretty much ruined facade that covered our society and political order (our so-called democracy) finally crumbled to dust.

It's actually less the revelations by Snowden (and, me visiting the Chaos Communication Congress for the first time, had my fair share of new revelations and other depressing news there) than the way our society, the politicians, the press, but also the general public reacting to them that finally cemented my belief that we're indeed now in a post-democratic state (As in state machine, not as in state prison). It's not that I think that all is lost, but I think that the way out of this crisis will either be extremely long and painful, or extremly violent.

Thing is: I have no idea what to do now. I have a few vague ideas on how we could fix society on a grand scale, but none of them is especially applicable in the current situation. I am just a software developer. A quite thoughtful software developer with strong political opinions, but one who now needs to take a step back and listen, read and make up his worried and confused mind on what would be a meaningful contribution to the future of our society.

And in the meantime, I will try to just be a software developer, at least here, in this blog. As much as I feel the pressure to comment on the current turmoil, I found out over the last months that I simply can't, at least not in a coherent, useful way. I'm afraid **"F\*\*K ALL OF THIS S\*\*T"** is hardly a useful contribution to the discussion, as much as it properly reflects my current feelings.

I hope that re-enables me to write on this blog. It will be, for the time being, more technical, more shallow, perhaps, but hopefully it will be revived in 2014 this way.

Here's to hoping that from here on, things can only get better (My pessimistic winter soul disagrees, but eff it).
