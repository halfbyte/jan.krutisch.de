Things don't run as smooth as I expected. The transition to my new employer includes a three week break which will see me without my beloved MacBook Pro (I will get a "new" one, as soon as I start at the new company).

Which means: No Textmate, No Quicksilver, No Growl. No Cigar.

So probably I won't code as much as I thought I would. Probably that's a good thing. I could improve my photography skills and start using my 35mm lens, finally. I could try to restart my music career. I could try to get a little more sleep.

Or I will try to tweak my Ubuntu to something almost usable for Rails development :)
