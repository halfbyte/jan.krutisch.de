So, our hopes were not in vain: soundbadge.net really won the "innovation" prize in the railsrumble. We are all still in shock. I need to thank my great team here: Florian, Karsten and Wolfgang. I am honored to be able to work with you.

Now that the hosting stuff is in place (We've won a year on a linode), we will start to explore the possibilities of the soundbadge concept for the future.

Thanks to everyone voting for us!
