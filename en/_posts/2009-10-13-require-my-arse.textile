Really. How hard can it be? Do you really have to prove that your metaprogramming skills are better than mine on the first five lines of your code? Like this:

{% highlight ruby %}
# MySpace libs
%w( connection object
  album detail friends friendship
  interest mood photo profile status user video
).each(&method(:require))
# Base libraries
%w( pp net/http cgi ).each(&method(:require))
{% endhighlight %}

How is this more readable, or in <strong>any</strong> way better than the long version?:

{% highlight ruby %}
require 'connection'
require 'object'
require 'album'
require 'detail'
require 'friends'
require 'friendship'
require 'interest'
require 'mood'
require 'photo'
require 'profile'
require 'status'
require 'user'
require 'video'

require 'pp'
require 'net/http'
require 'cgi'
{% endhighlight %}

Sorry, but I don't get it. Plus, the original construct, for some reason, fails for me inside my rails app, which I'll now have to investigate. Good times!
