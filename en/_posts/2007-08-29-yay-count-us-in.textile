I just registered for the Rails Rumble. Our Idea is pretty crazy and needs a lot of thought input before the rumble starts, but at least it seems to be pretty original.

Who's in the team? First of all, my (one of four) boss Wolfgang from <a href="http://www.mindmatters.de">mindmatters</a>, Florian aka <a href="http://theflow.de/">TheFlow</a> and my dear Bro from <a href="http://profile.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=user.viewprofile&amp;friendid=189881283">ClaepCaets</a>. And, of course, the mystic man himself. Me. Jan. (yeah, borrowing ideas from ATCQ can't be wrong).

We will, in one form or another liveblog during the rumble, I'm sure.

Oh and feel free to join us at <a href="http://jaiku.com/channel/railsrumble">#railsrumble</a> on jaiku (as well as on irc.freenode, of course)
