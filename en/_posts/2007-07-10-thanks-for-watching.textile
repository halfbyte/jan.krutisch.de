Yesterday evening was a fun event. We had a pretty good presentation, were able to answer almost any question, and almost 70 people were listening to our wise words. I had some pretty interesting conversations afterwards with old friends and colleagues. Then a few of us took some beers in the max &amp; consorten, including the current qype.com team and the wevent team. Now, if I only would have brought my business cards, that would have been great :)

Here are the slides:
