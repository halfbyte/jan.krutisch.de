Hah! Those bloody unreflecting americans again. :)

<a href="http://cruisecontrolrb.thoughtworks.com/" title="Thoughtworks: CCrb">Cruisecontrolrb</a> from Thoughtworks is great in it's simplicity and beauty. But it doesn't work if the locale of the user it's running under is set to something different than en-US. Reason: the commandline of SVN is localized and parsing of SVN output doesn't work if you look for (for example) "Latest Revision:", but SVN gives you "Letzte Revision:".

Fortunately, a simple "unset LANG" does the trick before starting CCrb.  The only solution I see is not using commandline tools but using svnlib for subversion access.

Added to that, CCrb doesn't seem to work with SVN 1.3.2 (although advertised), since SVN 1.3.2 doesn't support the --non-interactive switch.
