So, imagescience is all great, and it's integration into attachment_fu makes me feel warm and fuzzy inside. One large problem neatly solved.

Only, that executing /etc/init.d/mongrel_cluster restart is not such a good idea, out of the box. The story goes like this:
<ol>
	<li>mongrel_cluster_ctl tears down all mongrels. <span style="font-style: italic">No problem here.</span></li>
	<li>mongrel_cluster_ctl starts all mongrels. <span style="font-style: italic">Everything fine so far.</span></li>
	<li>ruby-inline (as used in image_science) tries to put its temp files in $HOME/.rubyinline. <span style="font-style: italic">Looks unsuspicious?</span></li>
</ol>
Only that $HOME is not what you expect it to be, since the user-changing mechanism in mongrel doesn't really boot up the whole user environment (nobody would expect that I'd say), so $HOME still points to /root/. <span style="font-weight: bold">Boom</span>.

The Solution? As usual, a one-liner, snatched from the <a href="http://sample.caboo.se/weed2/config/environment.rb">caboose sample app</a> (credit where credit is due):
<pre>ENV['INLINEDIR'] = "/tmp/ruby/"</pre>
Fortunately rubyinline is smart enough to not rely completely on the $HOME variable, but also looks for $INLINEDIR. So add the above line to your environment.rb and you are set.
